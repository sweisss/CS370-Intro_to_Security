# About
This repository contains implementations of the programming projects for the Oregon State University - Ecampus course CS 370 - Intro to Security.

## The projects are:
- [Encryption](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/tree/main/ProgrammingProjects/Encryption)
    - A multi-part project that involves different encryption/decryption tasks.
    - The final sumission is compiled in [this report](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/blob/main/ProgrammingProjects/Encryption/Weiss_CS370_ProgrammingProject1_Writeup.pdf).
- [Bloom Filters](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/tree/main/ProgrammingProjects/BloomFilters)
    - An implementation of a Bloom filter as well as an experiment to test the efficiency in terms of false/true positives/negatives.
    - The final submission is compiled in [this report](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/blob/main/ProgrammingProjects/BloomFilters/Weiss_CS370_ProgrammingProject2_Writeup.pdf).
- [OTP](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/tree/main/ProgrammingProjects/OTP)
    - Generates a QR code compatible with [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) app and a verification command.
- Damn Vulnerable Web App
    - A [report](https://github.com/sweisss/CS370-Intro_to_Security/blob/main/ProgrammingProjects/DVWA/Weiss_CS370_ProgrammingProject_DVWA_Report.pdf) on assessing the vulnerabilities of the DVWA challenge.
